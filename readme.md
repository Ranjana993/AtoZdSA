# WEEK 1 
## FlowChart : 
FlowChart is a graphical representation of  an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program - planning tool to solve a problem . It makes use of symbol which are connected among them to indicate the flowchart of information and processing .The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as `Flowcharting`,

## PseudoCode :
PseudoCode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do , expressed in a formally - styled natural language rather than in a programming language . PseudoCode is something used as a detailed step in the process of developing a program .

# Create Your First Program 🔥

# Programming Languages .
## Why we need it ?

🔹 A language using which we can instruct the computer to carry out real life tasks and computations is called a programming language . It acts as a language in which we could easily express out thoughts to the machine.
🔹 Like natural language , programming language has a fixed set of rules according to which programs could be written in it These programs are then converted into a language which machines can understand . This task is carried out by a special software called compiler .

🔹 Every language has its own compiler / interpreter .

🔹 Once a program is compiled and linked , its executable is created and the computer can run our program now .



# Data Type & Variable 
A variable in C++ is a memory associated with some name in order to store some form of data and retrive it when required & data types are used to tell variable the type of data they can store .

## 🔵TypeCasting :
## Implicit Vs Explicit 
Type casting refers to the conversion of one data type tp another in a prpgram . Typecasting can be done in thwo ways : automatically by compiler ans manually by the programmer or user . Type casting is also known as Type Convesion .


# Operators : 
🔹 Arithmatic (+ , - , * , / , %)
🔹 Relational (> , < , <= , >= , != ,== )
🔹 Assignment ( = )
🔹 Logical (&& , || , !)
🔹 Bitwise ( TODO :: pending )

# 🔵 Conditions 

🔹 If condition: Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

`if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}`

🔹 else: Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false 

`
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false  
}
`


🔹 else if:  Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

`if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} 
else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} 
else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}`

🔹 nested  if else:  Same  like else if only the difference is that we nest the condition.

`if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} 
else{
  if (condition2) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
   } 
    else {
     // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
    }
}
`

🔹 Switch: Use the switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


# 🔵 LOOPS : 

🔹 For loop 
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop

`for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}`

Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

# NUMBER SYSTEM 

## What is number System ?

1 . Method to reperesent numeric values or quantities using different  digits .

###  Decimal Number System 

1. The decimal number system has base 10 .

2. It uses digits from 0 to 9 .

3. Base : it is the number of Symbol (digits ) a number system users .

### Binary number system 

1. Number system using base 2 .

2. It uses only two digits i'e., 0 and 1 .


### Decimal to Binary Conversion .

🔵 Division Method

🔹 Divide number by 2 .

🔹 Store reminder . (That will be a bit in binary number ).

🔹 Reapeat about steps with the Quotient until  quotient is less than 2 .

🔹 Reverse the bits so obtained .

🔹 Add up all place values .

🔹 Sum is the Decimal number .




# WEEK - 03 (Time ans Space complexty )

## What is time complexity ?

Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of length .

## Why to study T&S complexity ?

1. Good computer engineer always thinks about the complexity of the code written by him .

2. Resources are limited .

3. Measure algorithm to make efficient programs .

4. Asked by interviewer after every solution you give .

## Space complexity ..

### What is Space complexity ?

1. Amount of space taken by an algorithm to sum as a function of length of input .

### Unit to represent complexity ..

1. Big O : Upper bound .

  * Constant time O(1).

  * Liner time : O(n) 

  * Logarithm time O(log N)

  * Quadratic time O(N^2 )

  * Cubic time : O(N ^ 3 )


2. Theta 0: Average case .

3. Omega : lower bound .


## ARRAY : 

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

`int myNum[3] = {10, 20, 30};
`


### Why array is needed ?

An array is a collection of variables in same datatype. we can't group different data types in array. Like, combination of integer and char, char and float etc. Hence Array is called as homogeneous data type.



# Vector : 

Vectors are the same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.

`vector<int>arr ; `

`vector<int>arr(size , initialised element);`


`vector<int>arr{2,3,4,5,6};`



## Methods (function) in vector ...

* push_back()

* pop_back() 

* size();

* capacity()

* empty();
