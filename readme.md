# WEEK 1 
## FlowChart : 
FlowChart is a graphical representation of  an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols that are connected among them to indicate the flowchart of information and processing. The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as `Flowcharting`,

## PseudoCode :
Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally - -styled natural language rather than in a programming language. PseudoCode is something used as a detailed step in the process of developing a program.

# Create Your First Program 🔥

## Programming Languages.
## Why do we need it?

🔹 A language using which we can instruct the computer to carry out actual life tasks and computations is called a programming language. It acts as a language in which we can easily express our thoughts to the machine.
🔹 Like natural language, programming language has a fixed set of rules according to which programs can be written These programs are then converted into a language that machines can understand. This task is carried out by a special software called compiler.

🔹 Every language has its compiler/interpreter.

🔹 Once a program is compiled and linked, its executable is created and the computer can run our program now.



# Data Type & Variable 
A variable in C++ is a memory associated with some name to store some form of data and retrieve it when required & data types are used to tell the variable the type of data they can hold.

## 🔵TypeCasting :
## Implicit Vs Explicit 
Type casting refers to converting one data type to another in a program. Typecasting can be done in two ways: automatically by the compiler and manually by the programmer or user. Type casting is also known as Type Conversion.


# Operators : 
🔹 Arithmetic (+ , - , * , / , %)
🔹 Relational (> , < , <= , >= , != ,== )
🔹 Assignment ( = )
🔹 Logical (&& , || , !)
🔹 Bitwise ( TODO :: pending )
