# WEEK 1 
## FlowChart : 
FlowChart is a graphical representation of  an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program - planning tool to solve a problem . It makes use of symbol which are connected among them to indicate the flowchart of information and processing .The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as `Flowcharting`,

## PseudoCode :
PseudoCode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do , expressed in a formally - styled natural language rather than in a programming language . PseudoCode is something used as a detailed step in the process of developing a program .

# Create Your First Program 🔥

# Programming Languages .
## Why we need it ?

🔹 A language using which we can instruct the computer to carry out real life tasks and computations is called a programming language . It acts as a language in which we could easily express out thoughts to the machine.
🔹 Like natural language , programming language has a fixed set of rules according to which programs could be written in it These programs are then converted into a language which machines can understand . This task is carried out by a special software called compiler .

🔹 Every language has its own compiler / interpreter .

🔹 Once a program is compiled and linked , its executable is created and the computer can run our program now .



# Data Type & Variable 
A variable in C++ is a memory associated with some name in order to store some form of data and retrive it when required & data types are used to tell variable the type of data they can store .

## 🔵TypeCasting :
## Implicit Vs Explicit 
Type casting refers to the conversion of one data type tp another in a prpgram . Typecasting can be done in thwo ways : automatically by compiler ans manually by the programmer or user . Type casting is also known as Type Convesion .


# Operators : 
🔹 Arithmatic (+ , - , * , / , %)
🔹 Relational (> , < , <= , >= , != ,== )
🔹 Assignment ( = )
🔹 Logical (&& , || , !)
🔹 Bitwise ( TODO :: pending )

# 🔵 Conditions 

🔹 If condition: Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

`if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}`

🔹 else: Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false 

`
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false  
}
`


🔹 else if:  Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

`if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} 
else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} 
else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}`

🔹 nested  if else:  Same  like else if only the difference is that we nest the condition.

`if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} 
else{
  if (condition2) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
   } 
    else {
     // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
    }
}
`

🔹 Switch: Use the switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed


# 🔵 LOOPS : 

🔹 For loop 
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop

`for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}`

Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
